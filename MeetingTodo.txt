Player icons currently show on the map even if they are in a vehicle. They should not show if they are in a vehicle.

We need to create new map icons for wounded players that are consistent with the other map icons.

Sometimes it is not possible to spawn on a FOB if it is deployed in a way where something is blocking the spawn point. We should ensure that FOBs cannot be placed if the spawn point is blocked, and if something (like a vehicle) is blocking the spawn point, there should be some kind of indicator to players why the FOB cannot be spawned on... or at least perhaps they can be spawned in a way that is outside of the blocked area.
